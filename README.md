## Overview

Manages the state of LXC based containers on a Ubuntu host.

## Module Description

This module installs LXC tools, LXC Ruby bindings, manages LXC service and configures
LXC networking settings. The lxc module adds the following resources to Puppet:

 * lxc
 * lxc_interface
 * lxc_cgroups

For more information about LXC visit: [linuxcontainers.org](https://linuxcontainers.org/).


## Reference

### Classes

#### Public Classes

 * lxc_ruby_bindings_provider
  Provider used to install LXC ruby bindings. Defaults to gem.

 * lxc_ruby_bindings_package
  Name for the LXC ruby bindings. Defaults to ruby-lxc.

 * lxc_ruby_bindings_gem_deps
  Name for the LXC ruby bindings gem dependencies. Defaults are distribution and release specific.

 * lxc_ruby_bindings_version
  Version for LXC ruby bindings. Defaults to 1.2.0.

 * lxc_lxc_package
  Package for installing lxc tools and libraries. Defaults to lxc.

 * lxc_lxc_version
  Version for $lxc_lxc_package. Defaults to latest.

 * lxc_lxc_service
  Name for lxc service. Defaults to lxc.

 * lxc_lxc_service_ensure
  Defines state for LXC service. Defaults to running.

 * lxc_lxc_service_enabled
  Enables/disables LXC service on boot time. Defaults to true.

 * lxc_networking_container_ensure
  Whether configuration is present or absent. Default is present.

 * lxc_networking_device_link
  Host device to be used as link, i.e. lxcbr0.

 * lxc_networking_type
  The networking type containers will use by default, i.e. veth.

 * lxc_networking_flags
  Networking flags, up activates the interface. Defaults to 'up'.

 * lxc_networking_hwaddr
  The parameter controls a fixed part of the MAC address, to randomly generate
  containers new MACs. Defaults to '00:16:3e:xx:xx:xx'.

 * lxc_networking_nat_bridge
  Bridge to be used as link device for containers. Default is 'lxcbr0'.

 * lxc_networking_nat_address
  Address for the bridge. Default '10.0.3.1'.

 * lxc_networking_nat_mask
  Mask address for the bridge. Default '255.255.255.0'.

 * lxc_networking_nat_network
  Network address for the bridge. Default '10.0.3.0/24'.

 * lxc_networking_nat_dhcp_range
  DHCP range, comman-separated. Default '10.0.3.2,10.0.3.254'.

 * lxc_networking_nat_max_hosts
  Maximum number of hosts to be assigned by the DHCP server. Default 253.

 * lxc_networking_nat_dns_domain
  DNS domain to be assigned by the DHCP server. Default undef.

 * lxc_networking_nat_dhcp_conf
  Configuration file to be used for LXC's DHCP server. Default undef.

 * lxc_networking_nat_dhcp_options
  A hash with DHCP specific options, it will be used to create
  the file pointed by $networking_nat_dhcp_conf. The end result
  will be in the format key=value. Default undef.

 * lxc_networking_nat_update_dnsmasq
  Whether to update system-wide dnsmasq instance to avoid it binding
  on $lxc_networking_nat_bridge. Default false.

 * lxc_networking_nat_dnsmasq_conf
  System-wide dnsmasq configuration file, where except-interface setting
  will be modified with $lxc_networking_nat_bridge value. Default
  /etc/dnsmasq.d/lxc.


* `lxc::install`: This class manages the installation of lxc tools, bindings and dependencies.

* `lxc::service`: This class manages LXC service state.

* `lxc::networking::containers`: This class manages the default networking settings for containers.

* `lxc::networking::nat`: This class manages the host networking settings to create a Nat'ed bridge.

  * autostart: enable/disable starting the container at boot time. Default false.
  * autostart_delay: time to wait before starting next container.
  * autostart_order: position on which the container will be started.
  * groups: array with all the container's groups.
  * config_options: custom lxc options to be added to container's lxc config file.


#### lxc_interface

  * name: Just a name...(public, private, ...)
  * container: container's name.
  * index: index number for the interface.
  * device_name: eth0, eth1, ...
  * veth_name_host: name of the veth pair device on the host (e.g. containername-eth0)
  * link: host interface where to link the container interface.
  * vlan_id: VLAN ID.
  * macvlan_mode: private, vepa or bridge.
  * type: defaults to veth.
  * ipv4: IPv4 address (can be string or array).

## Usage

```Puppet
# lxc class defining NAT'ed network.
class { 'lxc':
  lxc_networking_nat_address        => '10.0.4.1',
  lxc_networking_nat_mask           => '255.255.255.0',
  lxc_networking_nat_network        => '10.0.4.0/24',
  lxc_networking_nat_dhcp_range     => '10.0.4.2,10.0.4.254',
}


# Create ubuntu_test container based on ubuntu template, set its state to
# running, using as storage the VG vg00 and LV ubuntu_test01.
lxc { 'ubuntu_test':
  ensure           => present,
  state            => running,
  autostart        => true,
  template         => 'ubuntu',
  template_options => ['--mirror','http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu'],
  storage_backend  => 'lvm',
  storage_options  => {'vgname' => 'vg00', 'lvname' => 'ubuntu_test01'},
  config_options   => {'lxc.mount.entry' => '/dev/sda1 mnt ext4 defaults 0 2'}
}

# Will configure eth1 on container 'ubuntu_test', with two different IP addresses
lxc_interface { 'public':
  ensure       => present,
  device_name  => 'eth0',
  container    => 'ubuntu_test',
  index        => 0,
  link         => 'lxcbr0',
  type         => 'veth',
  ipv4         => '10.0.3.2/24',
  ipv4_gateway => '10.0.3.1',
  restart      => true,
}

lxc_interface { 'private':
  device_name => 'eth1',
  ensure      => present,
  container   => 'ubuntu_test',
  index       => 1,
  link        => 'lxcbr1',
  type        => 'veth',
  ipv4        => ['192.168.200.5/16','192.168.100.10/24'],
  restart     => true,
}

lxc_cgroups { 'memory.limit_in_bytes':
  container => 'ubuntu_test',
  value     => '1073741824',
}
```

## NOTES

 * All the networking settings in ```lxc_interface``` are only applied/checked to/from the
   container's configuration file, for them to take effect the container must be restarted
   (stopped/started), use ```restart => true``` if that's what you need.

## TODO

* Add support for current CentOS releases.
* Improve lxc-cgroup provider.
* Get rid of duplications.

## Limitations

 * The module lxc only works for Ubuntu 14.04, on other platforms with Ruby LXC
   bindings installed, the types should work as expected.
 * The lxc_cgroups provider is really basic, doesn't do much validation and currently it's
   not ensurable, as it seems not everything inside cgroups has a *reset* value. So,
   this provider only sets the given value in the given cgroup key.
 * lxc_groups provider is not able to use values such as 1G, cause when comparing, liblxc
   returns the values in bytes and puppet will set the value again.

## Contributions

Any contribution will be more than welcomed, specially in tests and Ruby parts,
I've tried to do my best, but it's far from perfect.

From version 0.2.0, a development branch is included in module's repository and all the
contributions should be made against it.

If a new feature is added, please, write the tests for it.
